## Rural Vs. City Life
I have lived both in urban and a rural environment.  For the first few years of my life I lived on Arvada, Colorado.  I loved living there.  Everything was just short walk or bike ride away.  I could walk to my elementary school in about 10 to 15 minutes.  My school friends also lived nearby and going over to play wasn't an issue.  Virtually everything that one can think of was nearby: the movie theater, hospital, grocery store, fast food, exercise center, etc.  Any extra time that it takes to get to the emergency room could have bad consequences.

But there are plenty of disadvantages as well with urban life.  For one, you get suspicious of those who are nice to you.  It is simply strange to talk to strangers because there is lack of trust for people in general.  This can make it harder to connect and participate in your community.

On the flip-side, it is easy to find others who have similar interests due to the higher number of clubs and organizations.  

When I moved on into high school my family moved up to Bailey, Colorado.  I immediately fell in love with the wondrous scenery here.  Of course words mean nothing.  This is a picture of the view off of our deck.

One the of the most notable differences about people in the rural setting is that people simply seem to genuinely care more about others.  This is perhaps for two main reasons.  Rural folk are more trusting and there is a need to be more connected for safety reasons.  

Of course rural life has it disadvantages as well.  One of the biggest things I miss is high speed internet.  In Arvada our internet was pushing 100+ Mbs.  Although, in Bailey the fastest available internet is a T1 line which is slower than 1 Mbs.  For some more fortunate regions microwave dish internet is available (capable of high speeds around 20 Mbs).  On the other hand, in some regions not even T1 is available and satalite internet must be used.
